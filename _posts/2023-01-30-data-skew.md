* **Data Skew**
* Data skew occurs when too many records are related to a parent record or owner in Salesforce
* It can occur when more than 10000 child records are associated with the same parent record or owner
* Data skew can negatively affect performance when inserting, updating or deleting a large number of records
* Data skew can cause record locking issues and a large number of time-consuming sharing recalculations
* 
* There are three types of data skew
    * Account Data Skew
    * Ownership Skew
    * Lookup Skew
* 
* **Account Data Skew**
* Occurs when too many child records are related to the same parent account record, eg: more than 10000 contacts are associated with the same account
* Account data skew can cause record locking issues and affect sharing performance
    * Record locking issues
        * Child records can fail to update due to record locking issues
        * Since the system locks both the parent account and the child record being updated, these issues can occur while updating a large number of child records associated with the same parent account in multiple threads
    * Sharing issues
        * When the owner of an account is changed, sharing recalculations need to be performed for all the child records, which includes recalculating the role hierarchy and sharing rules
        * If there are too many child records, this process can take a lot of time
    * 
    * Techniques for avoiding account data skew
        * A pool of accounts can be created and child records can be distributed among them using integration code or a trigger - the records can be redistributed in off-peak hours
        * A Public Read/Write model can be considered to ensure that the parent account status locked but sharing calculations do not occur for the child records
        * The number of child records associated with each account should be under 10000
* 
* **Lookup Skew**
* Occurs when too many child records are related to the same record in the lookup field
* For example, when 10000 records of a custom object lookup to the same record of another object, it causes lookup skew
* Salesforce locks the child record and the associated lookup record when a child record is inserted or updated
* This can cause exceptions when inserting or updating a large number of child records
* 
* There are many ways of mitigating the problems related to lookup skew
    * The record save time can be reduced to reduce the duration of locks
    * This can be done by increasing the performance of synchronous Apex code, removing unnecessary workflows, and using asynchronous processing
    * The lookup skew can be distributed to ensure that a large number of records do not look up to the same parent record
    * A picklist field can be utilized instead of a lookup field when the number of lookup values is relatively low
    * Automated processes or integrations running in parallel can be run serially during non-peak periods to avoid lock exceptions
    * 
* 
* **Ownership Skew**
* Occurs when a single user owns a large number of records
* When deleting records owned by the skewed user or updating the ownership can cause long-running sharing recalculations
* There can be performance issues if a skewed owner is moved around the role hierarchy, or if they are moved into or out of a role or group that is the source group of a sharing rule
* 
* A single user should not own more than 10000 records of an object, but if they need to, the performance impact can be minimized using certain strategies
    * A user who owns too many records of an object should be assigned to any role in the role hierarchy to reduce the sharing recalculations
    * If the user must have a role, it must be a separate role at the top of the hierarchy, and they should not be moved out of that top-level role
    * The skewed user must be kept out of public groups that could be used as the source for sharing rules to avoid performance issues
